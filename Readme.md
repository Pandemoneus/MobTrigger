Step by step guide on how to create your first trigger:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Find a suitable place where you want mobs to spawn. Make sure your cuboid area does not have any blocks inside (or mobs might spawn inside them and suffocate).
2. Type /mt select   (requires 'mobtrigger.trigger.select' permission)
3. With a lever in your hand, mark the corners of the cuboid, by clicking once on the first, then on the second.
4. Save your cuboid! Tpye /mt cuboid save MyFirstCuboid   (requires 'mobtrigger.trigger.cuboid.save' permission)
5. Now search for the trigger block you want to use (either a lever, button, wooden/stone pressure plate).
6. Click that block while NOT having a lever in your hand and still being in selection mode.
7. You got everything that we need now! Now type /mt trigger create 0 MyFirstCuboid 0 false 0 1   (requires 'mobtrigger.trigger.create' permission)
8. Now that we have created the trigger, we need to add mobs to it. Type /mt trigger set pig 3 to make 3 pigs spawn when we trigger it.  (requires 'mobtrigger.trigger.create' permission)
9. And we are good to go! Type /mt select to exit the selection mode.
10. Press the button/lever/pressure plate and see whether it works!   (requires 'mobtrigger.trigger.use' permission)
